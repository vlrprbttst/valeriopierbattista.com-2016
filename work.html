				<h2>C'è la partita domani a Roma?</h2>
				<p>
				This web app tells you if there's a soccer match in Rome the next day (or the same day). This is useful because the Olympic Stadium in Rome is right in the city
				center, and each time there's a match, a whole part of the city is jammed in traffic. This service is for those who don't follow soccer and don't
				know when the next match will be but want to get organized in advance or want to get mentally ready for the discomfort that awaits. <br><br>
				This is another collaboration with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/patriziomunzi" target="_blank">Patrizio Munzi</a> and the repository is on <a href="https://github.com/vlrprbttst/partita-domani-a-roma" target="_blank">Github</a>.

				<h2>WUTsapp</h2>
				<p>
					WUTsapp is a small web app created in collaboration with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/patriziomunzi" target="_blank">Patrizio Munzi</a>, and it's a collection of funny chat conversations. I've created the graphics, the concept and I've recreated
					the <a href="http://codepen.io/vlrprbttst/pen/dYPwbX" target="_blank">Whatsapp interface</a> with HTML and CSS. The source is on <a href="https://github.com/vlrprbttst/wutsapp" target="_blank">Github</a> and contributions are very welcome.

				<h2>HyperTV Christmas Card (2014)</h2>
				<p>
					We wanted to create something special and creative for HyperTV's 2014 Christmas card, not the same old html email. Working with the UX and Graphic Design team, we developed this interactive parallax scrolling christmas card for our clients to wish them
					a Merry Xmas and a happy 2015.

				<h2>Personal Online Résumé</h2>
				<p>
					I wanted to experiment with parallax scrolling animations and as my résumé was outdated, I decided to build an interactive one for the web. It was featured on <a href="http://onepagelove.com" target="_blank">onepagelove.com</a> (one of my favourite
					websites) and on many others and used as a creative example by <a href="http://ihatetomatoes.net" target="_blank">Petr Tichy</a> on his <a href="https://ihatetomatoes.net/product/parallax-scrolling-master-class/" target="_blank">online course</a>					(which I took).
